The enclosure is a simple hoop house design, using square tubing for the base and round tubing for the hoops. The base model is moved on skids.

### Project Inspiration
The design of this enclosure is loosely based on the [APPPA design](https://www.apppa.org/resources/Documents/building%20a%20multi%20purpose%20pasture%20shelter.pdf), but has been modified to improve manufacturability and part sourcing.
