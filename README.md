# ChickenEnclosure
Plans for enclosures for chickens, including 3D CAD models, manufacturing drawings, and sourcing guides. Variations for wheels, skids, and different sizes may be developed easily from a common base structure.

The design is inspired by the APPPA design, which can be found here: https://www.apppa.org/resources/Documents/building%20a%20multi%20purpose%20pasture%20shelter.pdf

CAD models are made in FreeCAD, a free and open source modeling software: https://www.freecadweb.org/downloads.php
Assemblies are made with the A2+ workbench, found in the Add-Ons Manager.
