The design is inspired by the APPPA design, [which can be found here](https://www.apppa.org/resources/Documents/building%20a%20multi%20purpose%20pasture%20shelter.pdf).

CAD models are made in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org), a free and open source modeling software.
Assemblies are made with the A2+ workbench, found in the Add-Ons Manager.
